          "content": "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\nAnd sorry I could not travel both\nAnd be one traveler, long I stood\nAnd looked down one as far as I could\nTo where it bent in the undergrowth;\n\nThen took the other, as just as fair,\nAnd having perhaps the better claim,\nBecause it was grassy and wanted wear;\nThough as for that the passing there\nHad worn them really about the same,\n\nAnd both that morning equally lay\nIn leaves no step had trodden black.\nOh, I kept the first for another day!\nYet knowing how way leads on to way,\nI doubted if I should ever be back.\n\nI shall be telling this with a sigh\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference."

          "content": "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\nThou art more lovely and more temperate:\nRough winds do shake the darling buds of May,\nAnd summer's lease hath all too short a date:\n\nSometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,\nAnd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;\nAnd every fair from fair sometime declines,\nBy chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;\n\nBut thy eternal summer shall not fade\nNor lose possession of that fair thou owest;\nNor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,\nWhen in eternal lines to time thou growest:\n\nSo long as men can breathe or eyes can see,\nSo long lives this, and this gives life to thee."

          "content": "I wandered lonely as a cloud\nThat floats on high o'er vales and hills,\nWhen all at once I saw a crowd,\nA host, of golden daffodils;\nBeside the lake, beneath the trees,\nFluttering and dancing in the breeze.\n\nContinuous as the stars that shine\nAnd twinkle on the milky way,\nThey stretched in never-ending line\nAlong the margin of a bay:\nTen thousand saw I at a glance,\nTossing their heads in sprightly dance.\n\nThe waves beside them danced; but they\nOut-did the sparkling waves in glee:\nA poet could not but be gay,\nIn such a jocund company:\nI gazed—and gazed—but little thought\nWhat wealth the show to me had brought:\n\nFor oft, when on my couch I lie\nIn vacant or in pensive mood,\nThey flash upon that inward eye\nWhich is the bliss of solitude;\nAnd then my heart with pleasure fills,\nAnd dances with the daffodils."

I have no preconceptions.\nWhatever I see I swallow immediately\nJust as it is, unmisted by love or dislike.\nI am not cruel, only truthful ‚\nThe eye of a little god, four-cornered.\nMost of the time I meditate on the opposite wall.\nIt is pink, with speckles. I have looked at it so long\nI think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.\nFaces and darkness separate us over and over.\n\nNow I am a lake. A woman bends over me,\nSearching my reaches for what she really is.\nThen she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.\nI see her back, and reflect it faithfully.\nShe rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.\nI am important to her. She comes and goes.\nEach morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.\nIn me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman\nRises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish."
