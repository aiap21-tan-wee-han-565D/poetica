I have looked at it so long\nI think it is part of my heart. But it flickers.\nFaces and darkness separate us over and over.\n\nNow I am a lake. A woman bends over me,\nSearching my reaches for what she really is.\nThen she turns to those liars, the candles or the moon.\nI see her back, and reflect it faithfully.\nShe rewards me with tears and an agitation of hands.\nI am important to her. She comes and goes.\nEach morning it is her face that replaces the darkness.\nIn me she has drowned a young girl, and in me an old woman\nRises toward her day after day, like a terrible fish.",
